#Description:
Pedagogical exercise in creating an ARIMA-GARCH on SKEW Index (Matlab)

Eddie Shim 7/6/2016

This paper serves as a quick service for me to build an ARIMA-GARCH 
(auto-regressive integrated moving average - generalized auto-regressive 
conditional heteroskedasticity) model on the CBOE Skew Index (SKEW) to see 
how a time series model forecasts this index to move in the near future.
