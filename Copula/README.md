#Description
Practicing copula theory and implementation.

This paper was created as a pedagogical exercise to understand copulas better. 
This program generates a t-copula with Tesla PnL and Toyota PnL, and then simulates a 
joint distribution from which a 99.97% VaR and Expected Shortfall(defined in document) are calculated. 
Additionally, I conduct a sensitivity test on copula parameters rho and nu.
